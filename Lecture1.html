												COMPUTER AND PROGRAM
											</h2>
											
												&emsp;Before we begin exploring the concepts of programming, you need to understand
												a few basic things about computers and how they work.
												The physical devices that a computer is made of are referred to as the computer's
												hardware. The programs that run on a computer are referred to as software.
												Computers can do such a wide variety of things because they can be
												programmed. This means that computers are not designed to do just one job, but
												to do any job that their programs tell them to do. A program is a set of instructions
												that a computer follows to perform a task.

											<br>
											
											<br>SOFTWARE
											
											<br>• System software
											<br>	&emsp;- Operating Systems: Windows, Mac OS, Linux
											<br>	&emsp;- Utility Programs: Back up, Virus scanners, Compression
											<br>• Software Development: Assemblers, Compilers, Interpreter
											<br>	&emsp;- Application software
											<br>	&emsp;- Microsoft word, PowerPoint, Pages, Editor, Photoshop

										
											<br>
												<br>HOW COMPUTER STORE DATA
												
												
											<br>	&emsp;
												All data that is stored in a computer is converted to sequences of 0s and 1s.
												A computer's memory is divided into tiny storage locations known as bytes. One
												byte is only enough memory to store a letter of the alphabet or a small number. In
												order to do anything meaningful, a computer has to have lots of bytes. Most
												computers today have millions, or even billions, of bytes of memory.

											<br>
											<br>	HOW PROGRAM WORKs
											
	
												<br>&emsp;
												A computer's CPU can only understand instructions that are written in machine
												language. Because people find it very difficult to write entire programs in machine
												language, other programming languages have been invented. The CPU is an
												electronic device that is designed to do specific things. In particular, the CPU is
												designed to perform operations such as the following:
											<br>	• Reading a piece of data from main memory
											<br>	• Adding two numbers
											<br>	• Subtracting one number from another number
											<br>	• Multiplying two numbers
											<br>	• Dividing one number by another number
											<br>	• Moving a piece of data from one memory location to another
											<br>	• Determining whether one value is equal to another value
											<br>
											<br>	HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGE
											
											<br>	&emsp;
													In the 1950s, a new generation of programming languages known as high-level
												languages began to appear. A high-level language allows you to create powerful
												and complex programs without knowing how the CPU works and without writing
												large numbers of low-level instructions. In addition, most high-level languages use
												words that are easy to understand. For example, if a programmer were using
												COBOL (which was one of the early high-level languages created in the 1950s), he
												or she would write the following instruction to display the message Hello world on
												the computer screen: &emsp;DISPLAY "Hello world"
												<br>	&emsp;Python is a modern, high-level programming language that we will use in this
												course. In Python you would display the message Hello world with the following
												instruction:

												<br>print('Hello world')

												PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT CYCLE
											
											<p>
												&emsp;Before we begin exploring the concepts of programming, you need to understand
												a few basic things about computers and how they work.
												The physical devices that a computer is made of are referred to as the computer's
												hardware. The programs that run on a computer are referred to as software.
												Computers can do such a wide variety of things because they can be
												programmed. This means that computers are not designed to do just one job, but
												to do any job that their programs tell them to do. A program is a set of instructions
												that a computer follows to perform a task.

											</p>
                                        </p>
									
										<p>
											&emsp;The process of designing a program is arguably the most important part of the
											cycle. You can think of a program's design as its foundation. If you build a
											house on a poorly constructed foundation, eventually you will find yourself
											doing a lot of work to fix the house! A program's design should be viewed no
											differently. If your program is designed poorly, eventually you will find yourself
											doing a lot of work to fix the program.

										<br>The process of designing a program can be summarised in the following two
											steps:
										<br>1. Understand the task that the program is to perform.
										<br>2. Determine the steps that must be taken to perform the task.
										</p><hr>

										<h2>TASK AND STEPS EXAMPLE</h2>
										<p>
											&emsp;For example, suppose someone asks you how to boil water. You might break down
											that task into a series of steps as follows:
											<br>1. Pour the desired amount of water into a pot.
											<br>2. Put the pot on a stove burner.
											<br>3. Turn the burner to high.
											<br>4. Watch the water until you see large bubbles rising. When this happens, the
											water is boiling.

											<br>&emsp;This is an example of an algorithm, which is a set of well-defined logical steps that
											must be taken to perform a task. Notice that the steps in this algorithm are
											sequentially ordered. Step 1 should be performed before step 2, and so on. If a
											person follows these steps exactly as they appear, and in the correct order, he or
											she should be able to boil water successfully.
											<br>
											<br>&emsp;A programmer breaks down the task that a program must perform in a similar way.
											An algorithm is created, which lists all of the logical steps that must be taken. For
											example, suppose you have been asked to write a program to calculate and
											display the gross pay for an hourly paid employee. Here are the steps that you
											would take:
											<br>1. Get the number of hours worked.
											<br>2. Get the hourly pay rate.
											<br>3. Multiply the number of hours worked by the hourly pay rate.
											<br>4. Display the result of the calculation that was performed in step 3.
											<br>&emsp;Of course, this algorithm isn't ready to be executed on the computer. The steps in
											this list have to be translated into code. Programmers commonly use two tools to
											help them accomplish this: pseudocode and flowcharts. Let's look at each of
											these in more detail.
										</p><hr>
										<h2>PSEUDOCODE</h2>
										<br>&emsp;The word “pseudo” means fake, so pseudocode is fake code. It is an informal
										language that has no syntax rules and is not meant to be compiled or executed.
										Instead, programmers use pseudocode to create models, or “mock-ups,” of
										programs. Because programmers don't have to worry about syntax errors while
										writing pseudocode, they can focus all of their attention on the program's design.
										Once a satisfactory design has been created with pseudocode, the pseudocode
										can be translated directly to actual code.

										<br>Input the hours worked
										<br>Input the hourly pay rate
										<br>Calculate gross pay as hours worked multiplied by pay rate
										<br>Display the gross pay<hr>
										<h2>FLOWCHART</h2>
										<br>&emsp;Flowcharting is another tool that programmers use to design programs. A flowchart
										is a diagram that graphically depicts the steps that take place in a
										program.Notice that there are three types of symbols in the flowchart: ovals,
										parallelograms, and a rectangle. Each of these symbols represents a step in the
										program, as described here:
										<br>• The ovals, which appear at the top and bottom of the flowchart, are called
										terminal symbols. The Start terminal symbol marks the program's starting point
										and the End terminal symbol marks the program's ending point.
										<br>• Parallelograms are used as input symbols and output symbols. They represent
										steps in which the program reads input or displays output.
										<br>• Rectangles are used as processing symbols. They represent steps in which the
										program performs some process on data, such as a mathematical calculation.

										<h2>Input Process Output</h2>
										<p>
											INPUT PROCESS OUTPUT
											<br>&emsp;Computer programs typically perform the following three-step process:
											<br>1. Input is received.
											<br>2. Some process is performed on the input.
											<br>3. Output is produced.
											<br>&emsp;Input is any data that the program receives while it is running. One common form
											of input is data that is typed on the keyboard. Once input is received, some
											process, such as a mathematical calculation, is usually performed on it. The results
											of the process are then sent out of the program as output.
											<br><center><img src="images/inputprocessouput.jpg" width="700" alt="" /></center><hr>

										</p>
										<h2>Variable ,Data Type</h2>
										<p>
											<h2>Variable</h2> 
											<br>• Variable are:
											<br>- Storage location that have a name
											<br>- Name-value pairs
											<br>VARIABLES
											<br>fruit = ‘apple’
											<br>fruit = ‘orange’
											<br>Note:* Pick variable name that represent data that variable will hold
											<br>
											<br>Valid Variable Names
											<br>• Case sensitive. (Case matters!)
											<br>- Fruit and fruit are different variable
											<br>• Must start with a letter.
											<br>- Can contain numbers.
											<br>• Underscores allowed in variable names
											<br>• Not allowed: + -
											<br>
											<br>Reserved Word
											<br><center><img src="images/reservedword.jpg" width="700" alt="" /></center>
											<br>*** Function name also not recommend
											<br><center><img src="images/syntaxerror.jpg" width="700" alt="" /></center>
											<br>*** Function name also not recommend
											<br>
											<br>Valid Variable Names
											<br>
											<br>first3letters = ‘ABC’
											<br>first_three_letters = ‘ABC’
											<br>firstThreeLetters. = ‘ABC’
											<br>Note:* Pick variable name that represent data that variable will hold<hr>
											<h2>DATA TYPE</h2>
											<br>NUMERIC INTEGER
											<br>• Basic Data Types
											<br>- Numeric
											<br>- Integer
											<br>- Floating point
											<br>- Boolean
											<br>- String
											<br>• Composite Data Types
											<br>&emsp;Later lessons
											<br>- List
											<br>- Tuple
											<br>- Dictionary
											<br>- Set
											<br>- NUMERIC INTEGER<hr>
											<h2>NUMBERS</h2>
											<br>•Use numbers directly in your source code
											<br>-Do not use quotation marks as they are for strings.
											<br><center><img src="images/number.jpg" width="700" alt="" /></center>
											<br>Note:* Pick variable name that represent data that variable will hold
											<br><center><img src="images/numbererror.jpg" width="700" alt="" /></center>
											<br>Note:* In Python, adding 0 in front of any number needs an extra
											<br>x (for hexadecimal) followed by any number in hex digits range 0-9 or a-f or A-F.
											<br>o (for octal) followed by number(s) in octal digits range 0-7.
											<br><center><img src="images/numberfinnsih.jpg" width="700" alt="" /></center>
											<br>Note:* display without decimal<hr>
											<h2>BOOLEAN</h2>
											<br>&emsp;A Boolean variable can reference one of two values: True or False.
											<br>Boolean variables are commonly used as flags, which indicate whether pecific conditions exist.
											<br>hungry = True
											<br>sleepy = False
											<br><center><img src="images/boolearn.jpg" width="700" alt="" /></center><hr>
											<h2>VARIABLES AND STRING</h2>
											<br>Strings
											<br>- Represent text
											<br>- Surrounded by quotes
											<br>VARIABLES AND STRING
											<br>&emsp;fruit = ‘apple’
											<br>&emsp;fruit = “apple”
											<br>&emsp;string1, string2, string3 = '', 'Knife', 'Hammer Dance'
											<br>Note:* Strings are start with ‘ or “ and end with ’or ”
											<br>Using Quotes within Strings
											<br>VARIABLES AND STRING
											<br>sentence = 'She said, "That is a great tasting apple!" '
											<br>sentence = " That's a great tasting apple! "<hr>
											<h2>PYTHON OPERATORS</h2>
											<br>&emsp;What are operators in python?
											<br>Operators are special symbols in Python that carry out
											<br>arithmetic or logical computation. The value that the
											<br>operator operates on is called the operand.<hr>
											<h2>ARITHMETIC OPERATORS</h2>
											<br><center><img src="images/operator.jpg" width="700" alt="" /></center>
											<br><center><img src="images/math.jpg" width="700" alt="" /></center>
											<br>Note:* Test +, -, *, /, //, **, % <hr>
											<h2>COMPARISON OPERATORS</h2>
											<br><center><img src="images/truefalse.jpg" width="700" alt="" /></center>
											<br>Note:* Test If yes true if not false<hr>
											<h2>LOGICAL OPERATORS</h2>
											<br><center><img src="images/truefalse1.jpg" width="700" alt="" /></center><hr>
											<h2>BITWISE OPERATORS</h2>
											<br>&emsp;In the table below: Let x = 10 (0000 1010 in binary) and y = 4 (0000 0100 in binary)
											<br><center><img src="images/bitwise.jpg" width="700" alt="" /></center><hr>
											<h2>ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</h2>
											<br><center><img src="images/math1.jpg" width="700" alt="" /></center><hr>
											<h2>IDENTITY OPERATORS</h2>
											<br>&emsp;is and is not are the identity operators in Python. They are used to check if two
											<br>values (or variables) are located on the same part of the memory. Two variables
											<br>that are equal does not imply that they are identical.
											<br><center><img src="images/operator1.jpg" width="700" alt="" /></center><hr>
											<h2>MEMBERSHIP OPERATORS</h2> 
											<br>&emsp;in and not in are the membership operators in Python. They are used to test
											<br>whether a value or variable is found in a sequence (string, list,tuple, set and dictionary).
											<br>In a dictionary we can only test for presence of key, not the value.
											<br><center><img src="images/operator2.jpg" width="700" alt="" /></center><hr>
											<h2>INPUT</h2>
											<br>INPUT
											<br>&emsp;Programs commonly need to read input typed by the user on the keyboard. We will use the Python functions to do this.
											<br>Python's built-in input function to read input from the keyboard. The input
											<br>function reads a piece of data that has been entered at the keyboard and
											<br>returns that data, as a string, back to the program. You normally use the
											<br>input function in an assignment statement that follows this general format:
											<br>variable = input(prompt)
											<br>name = input('What is your name? ')
											<br><center><img src="images/name.jpg" width="700" alt="" /></center><hr>
											<h2>INPUT NUMBERS</h2>
											<br>The input function always returns the users input as a string, even if the user
											<br>enters numeric data. For example, suppose you call the input function,
											<br>type the number 87, and press the Enter key. The value that is returned from
											<br>the input function is the string '87'. This can be a problem if you want to use
											<br>the value in a math operation. Math operations can be performed only on numeric values, not strings.
											<br><center><img src="images/inputnumver.jpg" width="700" alt="" /></center><hr>
											<h2>INPUT</h2>
											<br>Method 1
											<br>&emsp;string_value = input('How many hours did you work? ')
											<br>&emsp;hours = int(string_value)
											<br>Method 2
											<br>&emsp;hours = int(input('How many hours did you work? '))
											<br><center><img src="images/nameage.jpg" width="700" alt="" /></center>
											<br>Note:* Collect data and show it<hr>
											<h2>READ MULTIPLE VALUES FROM KEYBOARD</h2>
											<br><center><img src="images/read.jpg" width="700" alt="" /></center>
											<br><center><img src="images/read1.jpg" width="700" alt="" /></center>
											<br><center><img src="images/read2.jpg" width="700" alt="" /></center><hr>
											<h2>COMMENTS</h2>
											<br>&emsp;Comments are notes of explanation that document lines or sections of a
											<br>program. Comments are part of the program, but the Python interpreter
											<br>ignores them. They are intended for people who may be reading the source code.
											<br><center><img src="images/read3.jpg" width="700" alt="" /></center><hr>
