												COMPUTER AND PROGRAM
											</h2>
											
												&emsp;Before we begin exploring the concepts of programming, you need to understand
												a few basic things about computers and how they work.
												The physical devices that a computer is made of are referred to as the computer's
												hardware. The programs that run on a computer are referred to as software.
												Computers can do such a wide variety of things because they can be
												programmed. This means that computers are not designed to do just one job, but
												to do any job that their programs tell them to do. A program is a set of instructions
												that a computer follows to perform a task.

											<br>SOFTWARE
											<br>
											<br>• System software
											<br>	&emsp;- Operating Systems: Windows, Mac OS, Linux
											<br>	&emsp;- Utility Programs: Back up, Virus scanners, Compression
											<br>• Software Development: Assemblers, Compilers, Interpreter
											<br>	&emsp;- Application software
											<br>	&emsp;- Microsoft word, PowerPoint, Pages, Editor, Photoshop

												<br>HOW COMPUTER STORE DATA
												<br>
												
											<br>	&emsp;
												All data that is stored in a computer is converted to sequences of 0s and 1s.
												A computer's memory is divided into tiny storage locations known as bytes. One
												byte is only enough memory to store a letter of the alphabet or a small number. In
												order to do anything meaningful, a computer has to have lots of bytes. Most
												computers today have millions, or even billions, of bytes of memory.

											<br>	HOW PROGRAM WORKs
											<br>
	
												<br>&emsp;
												A computer's CPU can only understand instructions that are written in machine
												language. Because people find it very difficult to write entire programs in machine
												language, other programming languages have been invented. The CPU is an
												electronic device that is designed to do specific things. In particular, the CPU is
												designed to perform operations such as the following:
											<br>	• Reading a piece of data from main memory
											<br>	• Adding two numbers
											<br>	• Subtracting one number from another number
											<br>	• Multiplying two numbers
											<br>	• Dividing one number by another number
											<br>	• Moving a piece of data from one memory location to another
											<br>	• Determining whether one value is equal to another value

												HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGE
											</p>
												
												&emsp;
												In the 1950s, a new generation of programming languages known as high-level
												languages began to appear. A high-level language allows you to create powerful
												and complex programs without knowing how the CPU works and without writing
												large numbers of low-level instructions. In addition, most high-level languages use
												words that are easy to understand. For example, if a programmer were using
												COBOL (which was one of the early high-level languages created in the 1950s), he
												or she would write the following instruction to display the message Hello world on
												the computer screen: 
												<br>DISPLAY "Hello world"
												<br>	&emsp;Python is a modern, high-level programming language that we will use in this
												course. In Python you would display the message Hello world with the following
												instruction:

												<br>print('Hello world')
